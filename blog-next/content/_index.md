Welcome to **ScriptedStuff.dev**  
I'm David, a test automation engineer and home server enthusiast.

## About This Site

Here you'll find tutorials, tools, and thoughts on:  
End-to-end testing with Playwright & TypeScript  
Home lab and self-hosting projects (RPi, Docker, NGINX)

I created this site to share what I'm learning.

If you're into testing, RPI's or making your life easier with tech,
you're in the right place.
